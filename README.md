Hello, I am Ruinique.

I am currently a senior undergraduate and have also pursued my masterâ€™s degree at UESTC (University of Electronic Science and Technology of China). I am a member of the UESTC YOLO Studio.

Here, I would like to share some of my projects and welcome anyone to communicate and exchange ideas with me.
